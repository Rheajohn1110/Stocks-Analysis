# Stocks-Analysis
In this project,  I have combined two data sets for Tata Power and Adani Power Stock prices (2010-2023). These two companies are the major power houses in India and competitors as well. Through this project I aim to provide competitive analysis for both the companies. This project is divided into 3 parts.
